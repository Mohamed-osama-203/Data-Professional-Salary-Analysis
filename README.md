A Business Intelligence project using Power BI for visualization and RapidMiner for salary prediction modeling.
# Data Professional Salary & Satisfaction Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the factors that influence the salary and job satisfaction of data professionals globally. It combines descriptive analytics (Power BI) with predictive modeling (RapidMiner).

## 📊 Business Case
The goal was to answer: *What is the strongest predictor of a high salary in data?* Using a survey dataset, I built a model to categorize professionals into salary brackets based on their background and skills.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI:** Data cleaning, transformation, and interactive dashboarding.
- **RapidMiner:** Decision Tree Classification for predictive modeling.
- **Excel/CSV:** Data sourcing.

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Top Predictor:** The RapidMiner Decision Tree identified **Education Level (Q12)** as the most significant factor in determining salary brackets.
- **Dashboard Trends:** Professionals in the United States and those in "Data Engineer" roles showed the highest average compensation.
- **Model Accuracy:** The Classification model achieved an accuracy of **46.82%**.
